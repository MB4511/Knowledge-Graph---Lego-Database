## Lego Project 

In this project, I have dived deep into understanding the connectedness of the large and complex nature of networks between sets and 
themes in the world of Lego using Graph database technology of Neo4j. 

## Problem Statement

The problem identified here is that Lego sets have shown decline in sales for past few years limiting the shelf space for newer products
due to lack of shelf space. 2018 saw the first decline in sales since a decade and there is a need for Lego to make a shift in their marketing
strategies for a turnaround. 

## Solution - An effective recommender system using Neo4j capabilities

My solution is to design a recommender system which is able to provide personalized real time recommendations and help uncover some
relevant patterns and insights using Cypher to help improve the sales of Lego sets. 

This repository will take you through the queries written in Cypher and the corresponsing output of the business queries which 
form the framework of my proposed recommendation system
